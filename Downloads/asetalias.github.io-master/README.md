## Instructions

### Create and activate a python virtual environment
Create a virtual environment (You may have to run ```pip install venv```)
```
virtualenv VENV_NAME
or
python -m venv VENV_NAME
```
Activate Environment:
Linux:
```
source VENV_NAME/bin/activate
```
Windows:
```
./VENV_NAME/Scripts/activate
```

### Install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run build.py
Run build.py to automatically build and render top level html files. (Optional: Run SimpleHTTPServer alongside for easy testing)
```
python build.py & python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

### Make your changes
Don't make any changes to top-level HTML Files. Navigate to ```templates``` folder and make required changes in the required section/module.
StaticJinja will not track any changes made to any javascript/CSS/JSON files. Re-compile build.py to update any changes made to JSON files (no re-compile required in case of js/CSS).

### Preview your result
If you are using SimpleHTTPServer, you can view the changes at localhost:8000. If not, double-clicking the rendered index.html to view the result
